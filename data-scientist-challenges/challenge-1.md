# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Please solve the twitter sentiment analysis challenge from the link below: 
https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-twitter-sentiment-analysis/

As deliverables, we ask the following:

1. The code, ideally in the Jupyter notebook format (since it is convenient and intuitive for further discussions)
2. A report, detailing their solution approach, with emphasis on the machine learning technique used: from traditional to deep learning

After the challenge, you will have the chance to explain your solution and the techniques you were using. 

**Note:** We will NOT set a hard time limit for the completion of the challenge. But please try to submit the answer within a reasonable timeframe.
